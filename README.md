**Steele_et_al_2024.R**
I combined all of the R code used to analyze and visualize data into one document. 
This includes:
- Fisher's Exact Test (used for COG enrichment, protein localization, and social gene analyses)
- Barplots (for COG enrichment, protein localization, and social gene analyses)
- Heatmap (distribution of predation resistance gene homologs)
- Tanglegrams
- Running growthcurver

**constructing_ML_phylogenies.sh**
Instructions for constructing maximum likelihood phylogenies using RAxML or IQ-TREE.

**make_alignments_for_ML_phylogenies.sh**
Script for preparing alignment files for making phylogenies.

**make_percent_identity_heatmap.sh**
Instructions for running BLAST searches to make a heatmap showing the distribution of predation resistance gene homologs.
